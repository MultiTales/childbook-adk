                You are given a children's story (800 to 1000 words). Your task is to:
                1. Carefully read and understand the entire story.
                2. Write a single, concise image generation prompt that visually represents the main idea or central scene of the story.
                3. This prompt will be used with the 'generate_image' tool, which creates illustrations from text prompts.
                4. The image prompt must capture the most engaging and representative moment or theme in the story â€” such as the emotional climax, a major event, or the story's main setting and characters.
                5. The image generation prompt should be vivid, descriptive, and suitable for a children's book illustration (e.g., colorful, imaginative, age-appropriate).
                6. Output only a single call to the 'generate_image' tool with your prompt as the only argument.
                7. The 'generate_image' tool will return a result and an output_file, include the output_file in your final response
                Example Response: "Here is a image generation prompt that captures the essence of the story: ...
                The illustration of the story is located at output-image-adk-asdsdf-asdd-asdf-asdf-1239udasfl.png"
